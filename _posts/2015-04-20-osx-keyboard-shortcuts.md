After switching to OS X, one thing I've always missed in Windows and Linux is the ability to spawn menus using `Alt` `F`. Today I realized that OS X has two ways to accomplish this.
{:.brief-intro}

* **By arrows:** `Ctrl` + `F2` lets you navigate menus with arrow keys.
* **By typing:** `⌘` `⇧` `/` will get you the help menu.

### Spotlight for menus
The `⌘` `⌥` `/` shortcut is essentially a Spotlight for menu items—it opens the help menu where you can type in the menu item you want. Not all applications support it, though.

### Full keyboard access
Under the *Keyboard* preference pane, there's an option for *Full Keyboard Access*. I suggest enabling this, as this lets you navigate through file save windows with just the keyboard.
