If you're doing any work creating UI mockups, chances are you've downloaded a few [Google fonts] to your computer. Doing this manually is tedious, and you wouldn't be up to date when the fonts get updated.

[SkyFonts] is a free font syncing service that puts webfonts into your computer. It works with paid services like [fonts.com], but also offers unlimited support for Google Fonts.

This by far is the most convenient way to get Google Fonts onto your computer. Adding new fonts is mostly a one-click affair, fonts updates are automatically pushed to your computer, and you can even conveniently install the top 50 Google Fonts.

Monotype Skyfonts is available via [Caskroom] as `monotype-skyfonts`.
